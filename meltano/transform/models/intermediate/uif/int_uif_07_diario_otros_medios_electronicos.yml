      Intermediate model that consolidates withdrawal and deposit transactions for UIF regulatory reporting.
      This model performs the core business logic of identifying confirmed electronic payment transactions
      and preparing them for the UIF 07 daily report format.
      
      **Business Context:**
      The UIF (Unidad de Información Financiera) requires daily reporting of electronic payment transactions
      exceeding $25,000. This model focuses on two key transaction types:
      - Withdrawals: Customer funds moving from internal accounts to external bank accounts
      - Deposits: Customer funds moving from external bank accounts to internal accounts
      
      **Key Business Rules:**
      1. Only confirmed transactions are included (withdrawals with is_confirmed=true, deposits with status='Confirmed')
      2. Bank address information is cross-joined to provide service station details
      
      For detailed output schema and field descriptions, see the corresponding output model:
      `report_uif_07_diario_otros_medios_electronicos`.

    columns:
      - name: numeroRegistroBancario
        description: >
          Bank transaction record identifier. For withdrawals, this is the withdrawal's
          public id. For deposits, this is the deposit's public id. This serves as the 
          primary transaction reference in the UIF report.
